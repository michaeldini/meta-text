# backend

Purpose
- Contains the FastAPI + SQLModel backend source and related scripts.

Notes about docs
- TypeDoc targets TypeScript (frontend). Backend (Python) should be documented separately (e.g., in this README and `docs/`), or with Sphinx/pydoctor if you want automated backend API docs.

Quick pointers
- Useful to include: how to run the backend, database migration notes, and important env variables.
