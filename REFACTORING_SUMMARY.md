# MetaTextReviewPage Refactoring Summary

This document outlines the refactoring of the `MetaTextReviewPage.tsx` file into smaller, more maintainable components.

## Overview

The original `MetaTextReviewPage.tsx` was a single large file containing:

- Multiple component definitions
- Data fetching logic
- Type definitions
- The main page component

This has been refactored into a more modular structure for better maintainability, testability, and reusability.

## New File Structure

### 1. Types

- **`src/types/MetaTextReview.types.ts`**
  - Contains the `WordlistRow` interface
  - Exported through the main types index

### 2. Custom Hook

- **`src/hooks/useMetaTextReviewData.ts`**
  - Encapsulates all data fetching logic
  - Handles loading states and error handling
  - Returns all necessary data for the review page
  - Exported through the main hooks index

### 3. Components

All components are located in `src/components/MetaTextReview/`:

- **`LoadingIndicator.tsx`** - Displays loading spinner
- **`ErrorAlert.tsx`** - Shows error messages
- **`Header.tsx`** - Page header with navigation
- **`ReviewSection.tsx`** - Reusable accordion section wrapper
- **`ReviewContent.tsx`** - Main content layout with all sections
- **`index.ts`** - Barrel export for all components

All components are exported through the main components index.

### 4. Updated Main Component

- **`src/pages/MetaTextPage/MetaTextReviewPage.tsx`**
  - Significantly simplified
  - Uses the custom hook for data fetching
  - Imports and uses the extracted components
  - Focuses only on the main page logic

## Benefits of This Refactoring

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- Data fetching logic is isolated in a custom hook
- UI components are separated from business logic
- Types are centralized and reusable

### 2. **Improved Testability**

- Individual components can be tested in isolation
- The custom hook can be tested independently
- Mocking is easier with separated concerns

### 3. **Better Reusability**

- Components like `ReviewSection` can be reused elsewhere
- The custom hook can be used by other components
- Type definitions are available project-wide

### 4. **Enhanced Maintainability**

- Each file has a single responsibility
- Changes to specific functionality are isolated
- Code is easier to understand and modify

### 5. **Improved Developer Experience**

- Smaller files are easier to navigate
- Better IDE support with focused imports
- Clearer file structure and organization

## Usage Examples

### Using the Custom Hook

```tsx
import { useMetaTextReviewData } from 'hooks';

function MyComponent() {
  const { wordlist, chunkSummariesNotes, phraseExplanations, loading, error } = 
    useMetaTextReviewData(123);
  
  // Handle loading, error, and data states
}
```

### Using Individual Components

```tsx
import { LoadingIndicator, ErrorAlert, ReviewSection } from 'components';

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <ReviewSection title="My Section" testId="my-section">
      <MyContent />
    </ReviewSection>
  );
}
```

### Using Types

```tsx
import { WordlistRow } from 'types';

const wordEntry: WordlistRow = {
  id: 1,
  word: "example",
  definition: "a thing characteristic of its kind",
  definition_with_context: "an example of good writing"
};
```

## File Size Comparison

- **Before**: 1 file with ~400 lines
- **After**: 8 focused files with ~50-100 lines each

This refactoring maintains all existing functionality while significantly improving the codebase structure and maintainability.
