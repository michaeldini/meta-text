## Search feature outline

Here‚Äôs one way you might surface full-text search in the app and show results inline and in a sidebar:

1. Search Bar & Filters (top bar)  
   ‚Ä¢ A persistent MUI `<TextField>` with a search icon placeholder (‚ÄúSearch‚Ä¶‚Äù).  
   ‚Ä¢ Tag-filter chips below it (e.g. ‚Äú#chapter‚Äù, ‚Äú#comment‚Äù, ‚Äú#TODO‚Äù) that you can toggle on/off.  
   ‚Ä¢ A clear (√ó) button to reset both text query and tag filters in one click.

2. Live Results Sidebar (left pane)  
   ‚Ä¢ As you type, a scrollable panel opens (or pushes the document view right).  
   ‚Ä¢ Grouped by document or chunk header, each group shows:  
     ‚Äì A header like ‚ÄúSection 2: Introduction (3 matches)‚Äù  
     ‚Äì A list of up to 5 context snippets, e.g.:  
       ‚Äú‚Ä¶the quick brown **fox** jumped‚Ä¶‚Äù  
       ‚Äú‚Ä¶over the lazy **dog**‚Ä¶‚Äù  
   ‚Ä¢ Hover or click on a snippet to preview it in-place, click to navigate there.

3. Inline Highlights in Main Content  
   ‚Ä¢ All matching words/phrases in the document body are wrapped in a yellow highlight.  
   ‚Ä¢ Smooth scroll animation brings the first match into view upon search.  
   ‚Ä¢ Next/Prev arrows in the top bar cycle through matches, jumping the scroll and focusing each highlight.

4. Empty & No-Results States  
   ‚Ä¢ Empty query: sidebar hides, highlights cleared.  
   ‚Ä¢ No matches: sidebar shows ‚ÄúNo results for ‚Äúfoobar‚Äù‚Äù and suggests ‚ÄúTry another keyword or toggle off filters.‚Äù

Mockup in Markdown:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| üîç Search‚Ä¶ [fox]     [#chapter] [#comment] [#TODO]    ‚úï                         |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Section 1: Prologue (2 matches)|  | ‚Ä¶                Document Viewer         |
|  ‚Ä¢ ‚Äú‚Ä¶brown **fox**‚Ä¶‚Äù           |  |   # Chapter 1                              |
|  ‚Ä¢ ‚Äú‚Ä¶red **fox**‚Ä¶‚Äù             |  |   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet‚Ä¶             |
| ‚Üë Prev 1/2 ‚Ä¢ Next ‚Üì            |  |   ‚Ä¶the quick brown [highlighted] fox‚Ä¶     |
|                                |  |   ‚Ä¶                                    ‚Ä¶  |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
```

Interaction flow:

1. User clicks search bar (or presses ‚åò K), begins typing.  
2. Sidebar animates in with live matches.  
3. First match in document view is scrolled into view and highlighted.  
4. User clicks a snippet or uses Next/Prev arrows to move through hits.  
5. Toggling tag chips refines which chunks/documents appear.  

This gives instant visual feedback, context snippets for quick scanning, and smooth navigation to each occurrence.
