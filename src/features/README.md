# src/features

Purpose
- Higher-level features/pages composed of components and services (domain-specific UI and logic).

What to add
- Short feature descriptions, where the feature is mounted (routes), and links to related services/hooks.

TypeDoc note
- Keep implementation details minimal here; rely on TypeDoc for API surface documentation of exported hooks and utilities.
