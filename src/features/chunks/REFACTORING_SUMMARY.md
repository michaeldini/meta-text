# Chunk Tools Refactoring Summary

## What I've Done

Based on your `tool-features.md` requirements, I've restructured the chunks feature to better separate concerns and create a modular tool system.

## New Structure Created

### 1. **Tools Directory** (`tools/`)

Each tool is now self-contained with:

- Component (UI presentation)
- Hook (business logic)
- Index file (exports)

**Completed Tools:**

- âœ… `tools/split/` - Split Chunk Tool
- âœ… `tools/define/` - Define Word Tool  
- âœ… `tools/merge/` - Merge Chunks Tool

**To Refactor:**

- ðŸ”„ `tools/comparison/` - Comparison Tool (already exists, needs refactor)
- ðŸ”„ `tools/image/` - AI Image Tool (already exists, needs refactor)
- ðŸ”„ `tools/notes/` - Notes/Summary Tool (already exists, needs refactor)

### 2. **Components Directory** (`components/`)

Reusable UI components:

- âœ… `ChunkWords.tsx` - Refactored to use new tool system

### 3. **Layouts Directory** (`layouts/`)

UI layout components that compose tools:

- âœ… `dialogs/WordActionDialog.tsx` - Refactored to use Split & Define tools

### 4. **Types** (`tools/types.ts`)

Common interfaces for all tools to ensure consistency

## Key Benefits

1. **Modular**: Each tool is independent and reusable
2. **Testable**: Business logic separated from UI
3. **Consistent**: All tools follow same interface pattern
4. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps

1. Refactor remaining tools (comparison, image, notes) to new structure
2. Move toolbar components to `layouts/toolbars/`
3. Move tab components to `layouts/tabs/`
4. Create shared hooks in `hooks/`

## Usage

```tsx
// Import specific tools
import { SplitChunkTool, DefineWordTool } from '@/features/chunks/tools';

// Import layout components
import { WordActionDialog } from '@/features/chunks/layouts';

// Use in components
<WordActionDialog 
    word="example" 
    wordIdx={5} 
    chunkIdx={0} 
    // ... other props 
/>
```

This refactoring aligns with your tool-features.md vision of having organized, reusable tools that can be composed into different UI layouts.
