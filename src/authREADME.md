# Auth Files

authservice.ts
authStore.ts
useAuthFresh.ts

## how they are used

in app.tsx

    import { useAuthStore } from 'store';
    const { user, loading } = useAuthStore();

    import { useAuthRefresh } from 'hooks';
    useAuthRefresh();

in navbar.tsx

    import { useAuth } from 'index';
    const { user, logout } = useAuth();

in login.tsx

    import { useAuth } from '../../store/authStore';
    const { login, loading, error } = useAuth();

in register.tsx

    import { useAuth } from '../../store/authStore';
    const { register, loading, error } = useAuth();

## ai thoughts

Here’s an explanation of the authentication architecture in your app, based on the provided files:

---

## Overall Architecture

**1. Service Layer (`authService.ts`):**

- Handles all API requests related to authentication: `login`, `register`, `refreshToken`, `logout`, and `getMe`.
- Uses a shared API utility for HTTP requests.
- Returns user data and tokens as needed.

**2. State Management (`authStore.ts`):**

- Uses Zustand (with persistence) to manage authentication state: `user`, `token`, `loading`, `error`.
- Exposes async actions for `login`, `register`, `refreshToken`, and a synchronous `logout`.
- Stores the token in both Zustand state and `localStorage` for persistence.
- Provides a convenience hook (`useAuth`) for easy access to auth state and actions in components.

**3. Token Refresh Logic (`useAuthRefresh.ts`):**

- Custom React hook that decodes the JWT token to determine expiration.
- Sets a timer to refresh the token before expiry (2 minutes before, but at least 10 seconds from now).
- On refresh, updates the token and user state; on failure, logs out the user.

**4. Component Integration:**

- The main app (`App.tsx`) initializes auth state and triggers token refresh.
- Navigation and auth pages (`navbar.tsx`, `login.tsx`, `register.tsx`) use the store and hooks to access user info and perform auth actions.

## Critique

**Strengths:**

- **Separation of Concerns:** API logic, state management, and side effects are cleanly separated.
- **Modern State Management:** Zustand is lightweight and efficient, with persistence for user and token.
- **Automatic Token Refresh:** The custom hook proactively refreshes tokens, improving UX and security.
- **Clear API Contracts:** Service functions are typed and easy to maintain.
- **Logging:** Actions are logged for debugging and audit.

**Areas for Improvement:**

- **Token Storage:** Storing tokens in `localStorage` is convenient but less secure than HTTP-only cookies. Consider the threat model and whether XSS is a concern.
- **Error Handling:** While errors are captured in state, consider more granular error feedback for the user (e.g., token refresh failures).
- **Session Recovery:** On app load, if a token exists in storage, consider validating it immediately to restore session.
- **Role/Permission Support:** If you need role-based access, extend the user model and store accordingly.
- **Logout API Call:** The `logout` service function is defined but not used in the store’s `logout` action. Consider calling the backend to invalidate refresh tokens on logout.
