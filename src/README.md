# src

Purpose
- Contains the TypeScript React frontend source for the project (components, pages, services, hooks, etc.).

How to maintain
- Keep a short summary of the folder responsibilities here.
- Note important entry points (for example `src/main.tsx` or `src/index.ts`) and any conventions (naming, file organization).

TypeDoc integration
- When generating docs with TypeDoc, include this file by using the `--includes` option (for example `--includes src`).
- Use this file for high-level folder information that complements auto-generated API docs.

Editing guidance
- Keep this README short (3â€“10 paragraphs). Link to lower-level READMEs inside subfolders for more detail.
