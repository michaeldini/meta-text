                Imagine unlocking the true depth of every document you read. <b>Meta-Text</b> empowers you to upload, dissect, and truly engage with your textsâ€”one meaningful section at a time. <br /><br />
                <b>How does it work?</b> Upload a document that sparks your curiosity. Break it into sections that matter to you. Annotate each part with your thoughts, questions, and insights. <br /><br />
                <i>Transform passive reading into an active, personal journey of discovery. Your ideas belong here.</i>
            </Text>
        </Stack>
