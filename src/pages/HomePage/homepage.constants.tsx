                    Imagine unlocking the true depth of every document you read. Meta-Text empowers you to upload, dissect, and truly engage with your textsâ€”one meaningful section at a time.
                    How does it work? Upload a document that sparks your curiosity. Break it into sections that matter to you. Annotate each part with your thoughts, questions, and insights.
                    Transform passive reading into an active, personal journey of discovery. Your ideas belong here.
