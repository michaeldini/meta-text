                    Imagine unlocking the true depth of every document you read. Meta-Text empowers you to upload, dissect, and truly engage with your textsâ€”one meaningful section at a time.
                    How does it work? Upload a document that sparks your curiosity. Break it into sections that matter to you. Annotate each part with your thoughts, questions, and insights.
                    Transform passive reading into an active, personal journey of discovery. Your ideas belong here.

                    Your meta-Text is broken up into Chunks. Click on a word in a Chunk to see tools to act on that word: Split the chunk at that word, Look up the word, and at the end of each chunk is a merge arrow to merge chunks. Split your meta-Text into meaningful chunks.

                    Use tools that act on the chunk to add metadata to the chunk: Generate a summary, Generate an image from a prompt that represents the chunk, write notes, write a summary, ask a literature agent to comment on the chunk and your notes.
